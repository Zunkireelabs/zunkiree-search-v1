"""
CLINIC-BOOKING-TRUTH-BRIEF F1: the agent must never state or imply a booking
was made unless confirm_booking actually returned a booking_number in that
same turn. A live run showed the model narrating "मैले ... बुक गरेको छु"
("I have booked") on a turn where confirm_booking was never called — the
guard held (nothing was actually written), but the SPEECH was false. Fixed
by never letting the model compose the wrap-up text in that situation: the
reply is built deterministically from prepare_booking's own summary and the
turn ends immediately, so the model is never given a chance to generate a
false claim.
